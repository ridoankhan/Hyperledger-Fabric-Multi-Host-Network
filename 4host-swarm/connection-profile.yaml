 #
 # [Required]. A connection profile contains information about a set of network
 # components. It is typically used to configure gateway, allowing applications
 # interact with a network channel without worrying about the underlying
 # topology. A connection profile is normally created by an administrator who
 # understands this topology.
 #
 name: "aid-distribution"
 #
 # [Optional]. Analogous to HTTP, properties with an "x-" prefix are deemed
 # "application-specific", and ignored by the gateway. For example, property
 # "x-type" with value "hlfv1" was originally used to identify a connection
 # profile for Fabric 1.x rather than 0.x.
 #
 x-type: "hlfv1"

     # this route as an alternative when it exists.
